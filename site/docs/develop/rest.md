# Rest API

Nessie's REST APIs are how all applications interact with Nessie. The APIs are specified 
according to the openapi v3 standard and are available when running the server by going 
to [localhost:19120/q/openapi](http://localhost:9000/q/openapi). You can also peruse the set of operations our APIs support 
by going to [SwaggerHub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/projectnessie/nessie).

If you are working in development, our Quarkus server will automatically start with 
the swagger-ui for experimentation. You can find that at [localhost:9000/q/swagger-ui/](http://localhost:9000/q/swagger-ui/)
