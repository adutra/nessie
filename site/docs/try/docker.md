As part of each release, Nessie is made available as a Docker image. This is the easiest
and fastest way to try out Nessie locally and test all its capabilities.

The primary repository for Nessie images is [GitHub Container Registry]. Images are also mirrored
to [Quay.io]. Note that Nessie images are no longer published or synced to Docker Hub.

[GitHub Container Registry]: https://ghcr.io/projectnessie/nessie
[Quay.io]: https://quay.io/repository/projectnessie/nessie

The image is relatively small and builds on top of standard base images. To get started:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/projectnessie/nessie
```

You should see something like this:

```text

```

Once the image is downloaded, you can start it with:

```bash
docker run -p 19120:19120 ghcr.io/projectnessie/nessie
```

You should see something like this:

!!! note
    If you see a warning about `OIDC Server is not available` in the logs, you can safely ignore it 
    for now. This happens in older Nessie versions because Nessie was configured to use OIDC by 
    default to authenticate users, but no OIDC server was configured out of the box.

If you need to configure Nessie, you can do so by passing in environment variables. For example, you
can change the port Nessie listens on by passing in the `QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT` environment variable:

```bash
docker run -p 19120:19120 -e QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=8080 ghcr.io/projectnessie/nessie
```

Check all the available configuration options in the 
[configuration reference](../try/configuration.md).

Once the docker image is up and running, you can install the [Nessie cli](../tools/cli.md).

```bash
pip install pynessie
```

You're now ready to start using Nessie. To create a new branch, you can do
the following:

```bash
# create a branch pointing to the same hash as
# the current default branch (typically the main branch)
nessie branch my_branch
```

From there, you can use one of the three main Nessie integrations of:

* Take a look at your current empty repository in the [Web UI](../tools/ui.md)
* NessieCatalog for [Spark via Iceberg](../tools/iceberg/spark.md) integration
* Try [Nessie on Kubernetes](../try/kubernetes.md), on your cloud provider or 
  [on your laptop](../guides/minikube.md)
